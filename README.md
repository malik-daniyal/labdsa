### Pipe and Filter Architecture – Overview  

The pipe and filter architectural pattern is a design approach used to process data through a sequence of independent stages (filters) connected by channels (pipes). Each filter processes the data, transforms it, and passes the output to the next filter through a pipe.  

core components of pipe and filter:  
1. filters: independent units that perform a specific task (e.g., transformation, validation, or aggregation). each filter processes the input and produces the output.  
2. pipes: connect filters and transfer data between them. they allow filters to operate sequentially.  
3. input/output: the system accepts input data, processes it through a series of filters, and outputs the transformed result.  

how it works:  
1. input: raw data is sent to the first filter.  
2. processing: each filter applies a specific transformation to the data.  
3. output: final processed data is produced after passing through all filters.  

advantages of pipe and filter architecture:  
1. modularity: each filter is a self-contained unit, making it easy to add, remove, or update individual filters.  
2. reusability: filters can be reused in multiple pipelines for different applications.  
3. scalability: new filters can be added without changing the existing ones, enabling system expansion.  
4. simplicity: each filter handles a specific task, making the system easier to understand and maintain.  
5. parallel execution: filters can run concurrently, improving performance.  

disadvantages of pipe and filter architecture:  
1. performance overhead: data is copied between filters, which may cause inefficiencies.  
2. complex data sharing: filters are independent, making shared state management complex.  
3. error handling: managing errors across multiple filters is more complicated.  
4. latency: sequential processing may introduce latency in real-time applications.  

real-world examples:  
1. data processing pipelines: used in etl (extract, transform, load) systems for data analysis.  
2. compiler design: tokenizer → parser → semantic analyzer → code generator.  
3. image processing: each filter applies transformations (e.g., grayscale, blur, edge detection).  
4. log processing: parse → filter → aggregate → report.  

when to use pipe and filter:  
- when you need to apply a sequence of transformations to data.  
- systems requiring modular and maintainable design.  
- applications with clearly defined, reusable processing steps.  
- for tasks like logging, compiling, and data transformation.
